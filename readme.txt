== Description ==
Google Maps on your blog, the easy way!

Yes, there are lots of Google Maps WordPress Plugins out there, but none of these fulfilled my needs:

*    Automatically placing a Google Map inside every post just writing the address in a custom field.
*    Live example: the Pantheon in Rome (single post map)
*    Learn how to do it now reading the plugin tutorial
*    Generating a Global Map with all the posts, placing this global map in a standard WordPress Page via a simple [GLOBALMAP] shortcode.
*    Live example: http://www.romeluv.com/map
*    Filtering the Global Map adding just a category parameter to the URL.
*    Just add the parameter like shown above to your page’s URL, where you’ve placed the global map shorttag.

    As you can see by the live examples shown before, this plugin was developed for the RomeLuv site, a WordPress blog featuring a cool Google maps implementation to map what we recommend in Rome: bars, cafes, restaurants, attractions…those are just posts in different categories as it is plain to see.

    The use of the plugin can be quite large, from building a geoblog to a classifieds site, many WordPress sites can benefit by this simple and fast Google integration plugin. Enjoy. Price is just a small credit link to this page on your global map, should you build one.


== Installation ==


1. Download, install and activate  this free WordPress plugin.

2. Get a free Google Maps API key for your website, directly from Google

3. Configure the only plugin setting: paste the Google Maps API key as shown below and confirm.

You’re pretty much done.
