Google Maps on your blog, the easy way!

Yes, there are lots of Google Maps WordPress Plugins out there, but none of these fulfilled my needs:

== Description ==

This plugin allows in minutes to:

*    Automatically place a Google Map inside every post just writing the address in a custom field.
*    Live example: the Pantheon in Rome (single post map) http://www.romeluv.com/blog/353-pantheon
*    Learn how to do it now reading the plugin tutorial at http://www.romeluv.com/maps-plugin-testrun/how-to-setup/ for instructions and screenshots.
*    Generates where you want a Global Map with all the posts, placing this global map in a standard WordPress Page via a simple [GLOBALMAP] shortcode.
*    Global Map Live example: http://www.romeluv.com/map
*    Can filter  the Global Map adding just a category parameter to the URL, just add the parameter like shown above to your page’s URL, where you’ve placed the global map shorttag.
*    Example URL : Eating in Rome http://www.romeluv.com/map?cat=6

    As you can see by the live examples shown before, this plugin was developed for the RomeLuv site, a WordPress blog featuring a cool Google maps implementation to map what we recommend in Rome: bars, cafes, restaurants, attractions…those are just posts in different categories as it is plain to see.

    The use of the plugin can be quite large, from building a geoblog to a classifieds site, many WordPress sites can benefit by this simple and fast Google integration plugin. Enjoy. Price is just a small credit link to this page on your global map, should you build one.
